# FindCitiesByPC
This repository containing a simple application that allows users to search for cities in France by postal code, it uses PHP and HTML to create a simple web application
# #Usage
To use this application, simply enter a postal code in the input field and press Enter. The application will then make a request to a PHP file that queries a database for all cities with the specified postal code. The results of the query will then be displayed in the ville span element.

# #Context

This application was created as a way to demonstrate how to use PHP and HTML to create a simple web application. The application also demonstrates how to use AJAX to make requests to a PHP file and how to update the content of a web page dynamically.

# #Files

The following files are included in this project:

-   index.html - The main HTML file for the application.
-   requete.php - The PHP file that queries the database for cities.
-   README.md - This file, which provides information about the application.

# #To run the application

To run the application, you will need to have a web server installed on your computer. Once you have a web server installed, you can upload the files to the web server and then open the index.html file in a web browser.
  
This application could be further developed in a number of ways. For example, you could add a search button to the input field. You could also add a filter to the search results so that users can only see cities that meet certain criteria, such as cities with a population of over 100,000 people
